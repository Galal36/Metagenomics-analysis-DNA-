# Metagenomics-analysis-DNA-
This metagenomics analysis's purpose is to explain the most common types of bacteria spread in ruminants.
The objective of this metagenomics analysis is to elucidate the prevailing bacterial species found in ruminant populations. By utilizing fasta or fastaq files containing DNA sequences, it is possible to generate an initial broad overview of the bacterial composition. This is a presentation using some programming language (used, like R and Python) that shows the development of methane in Protozoa type.

These bacteria encompass various taxa, such as archaea, protozoa, and fungi. By comparing a standardized motif within the file that is specifically associated with methane emissions (the primary focus), to the motifs present in known bacterial families, it becomes feasible to discern potential relationships and associations.

In this shot, I tried to print using Mothur tool, the relatedness between methane emissions in rumens and some types of bacteria ![Untitled](https://github.com/Galal36/Metagenomics-analysis-DNA-/assets/109338500/0d33afaa-ade8-45d4-901c-749e9bd576c8)
